methods left in Functions class

- adjacent
	- At first glance, I was going to put it into the Point class, but I realized it did not fit well in one class
          over another as it could be associated with multiple classes.

- getImageList
        - idk imma move this later

- loadImages
        - will be moved in later projects

- processImageLine
        - will be moved in later projects

- getImages
        - will be moved in later projects

- setAlpha
        - will be moved in later projects

- load
        - will be moved in later projects

- processLine
        - will be moved in later projects

- parseBackground
        - will be moved in later projects 

- parseMiner
        - will be moved in later projects 

- parseObstacle
        - will be moved in later projects

- parseOre
        - will be moved in later projects

- parseSmith
        - will be moved in later projects

- parseVein
        - will be moved in later projects

- nearestEntity
        - This method was left in the Function class because it was hard to draw the line between whether the Point
          class or the Entity class should determine where the closest entity is.

- distanceSquared
        - Similar to the adjacent method, I was initially going to move it to the Point class. However, I
          determined it was compatible with several classes, and there was not a clear choice.
